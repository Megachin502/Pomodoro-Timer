The Pomodoro Method is a productivity technique that is used to manage time. The idea is that there are intervals of time where one works, then there is a short break. The short break is extremely short therefore giving the perception that not a lot can be done. This snaps the brain back into work mode because it gets bored. My program runs intervals of 25 minute work times then 5 minute break times. On the fourth interval, there is a 15 minute break. There are sound notifications and color indicators as to when work and break times end. This cycle is repeated continuously with stop, pause, reset controls via JButtons.
